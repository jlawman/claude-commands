Act as a senior code reviewer and analyze the code in the current file or the changes Iâ€™ve made (whichever is provided). Provide exactly three specific improvement suggestions, focusing on:

1. **Maintainability**: Ways to improve structure or modularity for future changes.
2. **Edge Cases**: Potential bugs or unhandled scenarios to address.
   
For each suggestion, include:
- **Location**: [filename and line number, if applicable]
- **Issue**: [brief description]
- **Fix**: [specific recommendation]
  
If fewer than three issues exist, suggest minor enhancements to meet the count.
