Ask the user for the tool API name (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

Create a simple route that sends information to the API that they mention and create a sample page under test/[tool-api-name]/page.tsx. 

The information received from the API should be displayed on the page. They may specify the model/details of the API call, but if they don't just set up something that interacts with the API.

This an app router project. Let's make the test page feel modern and up to date. You can use Tailwind CSS. 

When you are done please communicate what API key needs to be set in the .env.local file.
