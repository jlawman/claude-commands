Wow let's make this Next.js 14 app router page look better and have a much improved UX experience! Let's also improve it by creating beautiful components that power it. Use literally any library you want!

Get inspired by TailwindUI, Sonner, Linear, and other people who care about making incredible UX.

Important however, just focus on the look and feel. You can do things like add additional buttons (or nav bar or sections) if the links exist elsewhere on the page. And you can possibly add a tiny bit of text if it makes sense. But DO NOT assume anything that can't be confidently inferred from the original page. (I.e. don't fill in missing text just because it should be there if you don't know what it is.). Don't add explainers of what the page or site does unless you are 200% sure.

Now let's make the page more pleasurable to use!
