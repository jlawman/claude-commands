Verify that the project builds successfully by running `npm run build`. If the build fails, analyze the error messages and fix the issues without changing the core functionality of the application. Follow these steps:

1. Run `npm run build` and capture any error output
2. For each error:
   - Identify the root cause (type errors, missing dependencies, etc.)
   - Make minimal changes to fix the issue
   - Document what was changed and why
3. After fixing, verify the build succeeds with another `npm run build`

Common issues to look for:
- TypeScript type errors
- Missing or incompatible dependencies
- Import/export problems
- Environment variable configuration
- Next.js configuration issues
- Unused or incorrectly referenced components

If you need to modify any files, show the original code, your changes, and explain your reasoning. Focus on making the minimal necessary changes to get the build working without altering the application's behavior or features.

If the build already succeeds, report that the project is building correctly and no changes were needed.

If you can't get the build to work without major changes communicate this.
