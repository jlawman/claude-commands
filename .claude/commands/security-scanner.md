Scan the current codebase for common security vulnerabilities, focusing on issues relevant to a Next.js project with LLM integrations (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded API keys, improper LLM response handling, CORS misconfigurations). Provide a report in this format for each issue:
- **File**: [filename]
- **Line**: [line number]
- **Issue**: [description]
- **Mitigation**: [specific suggestion]
Only list actual vulnerabilities found; do not include "no issues" messages if none are detected.
