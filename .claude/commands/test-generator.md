Identify functions or modules in the current directory lacking test coverage (or use the file I specify as an argument). Generate a comprehensive test suite using [Jest/Vitest/Mocha/Cypress] (or your preferred testing framework), including:
- At least one test for normal behavior.
- At least one test for an edge case (e.g., empty input, invalid data).
- At least one test for error handling (e.g., API failure).
- Mocks for external dependencies where appropriate.

Consider implementing tests for:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for connected components
- API endpoint tests if applicable

Output the test code in a format ready to save as `[filename].test.js` or appropriate extension. Include comments explaining each test's purpose and any setup required. If no untested code is found, suggest a basic test suite for a key function or component in the project.
