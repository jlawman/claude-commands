Undate the readme file for the current project based on the diffs in the git repo. The user has requested that this diff be reflected in the readme.

The readme should be internal focusing. This is not a public facing readme. We want to help developer understand the project at a high level and be able to run it locally (where relevant).

Please leave everything you can in tact and make minimal changes to support the new changes.
